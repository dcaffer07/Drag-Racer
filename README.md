## Planning - detailed description with images
#### Purpose & Expectations
> To work diligently in order to create a product that improves and expands our overall knowledge of how basic engineering operates.  We are expected to work professionally, using our time and resources wisely.  We are expected to work with our partners efficiently to create an object that operates under the parameters provided. With this we will create a device that incorporates all of the aspects of engineering we have learned about to scare and startle those who arenâ€™t scared and startled enough in an effort to make the world a less scared-and-startle-free space.

#### Description (establishing the foundation)
#### Planning Document
[Here is the planning doc that was created pre-creation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ydlslu0jilWMhaa84WuWhr467ZRmgDgo2GTIVmntT8/edit#heading=h.ukbi0a75zb46)

#### Initial Sketch

#### Reflection of Planning (done post project)
> All in all i think that our planning went well. In all honestly I wish that we had looked more closely into the logic behind things, ball as I said, the project turnmed out similaraly to as we expected.  Howver with that being said, here are some things that I wish I had known or looked more closely into before the assignment...
>- We did not really consider the buttons role in the project. Come run time, we had no way tto acces the button while still having the frame on tope of the car.
>- I would have liked to have left more space in most aspects... this was the case in the wheel situation, as the wheels initially didnt fit so we had to sand the base down.  This was also the case in the gears as they were more taught than anticpated.  
>- I would have like to more closely pay attention to the timeline aspect of planning.  I feel like we were nonchalaunt in the biggining, and crunching for time toward the end.  But we got it done.
>- Complete engineering noteboom as you go along.  I have said this before and I say it again, it is a mistake that we have made and I consistently seen my classmates make... do notebook!
>
> As stated, our planning was not perfect, but it was sufficient and seemed to work well enough.  


## Materials Used
>- Acrylic (base of box and windows)
>- 3d printer (gears, gear shaft, outer frame, moter holders)
>- Standard button (for initialization)
>- Wires 
>- T-Slot Photointerupter (To send racer)
>- H-Bridge (signals servo to stop)
>- TT Motor X 2
>- Panel Mount LED
>- Panel Mount Switch
>- Arduino...  prototyping sheild... mini bread board
>- Battery pack (6 x AA)
>- Screws/nuts/washers... assorted

## CAD Model - Link and Images
#### Description
> While planning, we liked the idea of an open concept car.  This was the case because although we wanted an outer shell in order for the object to look like a car, we liked the idea of being able to see the insides of the device.  This design concists of a base, which holds all of the neccesary electronics along with the gears and shaft mechamism, while having an outer shell frame made of 3D printed material, covered in clear acrilic.  These arcilic "winodwms" allow for the LED and Switch to be attatched in the back with the photointerupter in the front window.  With this desighn, we should be able to combine functionality with our own sence of style, while utilizing the wide array of materials at our disposal.

#### Reflection
> All in all the construction and printing itself was relatively easy despite a few hiccups, however after going through it, here are a few takeaways from my experience creating this...
>- Prevent the use of unnesary material... try to be mindfull of what is being used, especially when working with 3D material.  We were initially planning on a completely 3D printed object, howver that would not have been costly and efficent.
>- But batterie packs facing outside the object for easy access to batterry switches.
>- Always leave yourself more room than anticipated. The wheels fit in the CAD design but not in real life which was frustrating.
>- Attatch accordingly and in order and make sure that you  have a full understanding of what needs to happen... we did not largely consider the button which is very important.
>All in all it was a fun build and I am pretty super happy with the way it came out.

#### Description
> The goal of our code is to turn our servo when the Ultrasonic sensor detects a hand and stop the servo when the photoresistor detects an increased light level indicating the box has opened. To do this we used various if statements. In order to control at what distance the ultrasonic sensor would tell the servo to turn and at what brightness to turn off, we wrote a statement with the chosen distance or brightness. However, it took several tests with different values to get one that would correctly tell the servo when to start turning and when to stop.

    }

#### Reflection
> We expected the code to be very challenging because of the many components we had but it was probably the easiest part of the project and we completed it in a couple class periods. However when writing future code here are some lessons ...    
>- Always double check your pin holes to make sure they are in the correct spot. You can waste a lot of time trying to find an issue with your code when it might be a problem with your wiring.
>- Be very careful with short circuits. We had a lot of trouble connecting and uploading our code to the arduino because the metal nuts we were using to attach our arduino to the base were creating a short circuit in the arduino. 
>- Talking through what your code is going to do in english really helps you understand the ordering of your functions and what your code is supposed to accomplish.    
## Final Design/Product

> Dom
> - All in all, I am happy with how our prject turned out. It was deffinetly challenging, howver we were able to overcome some tough mishaps and calculations, which I could not be more happy with.  In all honesty I think that we amy have been slightly rushed, howver I do not beleive that we were the only ones and we were still able to make them most of our design. This project has challenged me as a whole, and I look forwad to more like it in the future.

## Reflection - Include an in-depth discussion of problems, errors, miscalculations, and missteps and how you overcame them
> The prosses of making the drag race was extremly frustraiting. We ran into several issues primarily with our code that took several class periods to fix.
>- When wiring up the arduino some of our wires were long so we created sevearl short circuts that prevented the arduino fuctioning as intended. However this issue was fixed by replacing the more problamtic wires and double checking how our arduino was mounted to our base. 
>- A second issue we had was with our rear axel we did not make it long enough and as a result the wheels would scrape along the sides of our base. This was fixed by reducing the width of the base where the rear axel was located, but doing this meant we could no longer attach our side panels beacuse they would interfere with our wheels. This was disapointing but the lesson learned was to make a larger axel so we would have more wiggle room when mounting our wheels. 
>- Time managment was the final issue with our project. We could have been more focused during some class periods so we would not have to stress over completing a large part of the project in the last few days. 
> Overall I really like the design of our car, and it looks really cool. The build experience and the coding however was not fun due to the issues mentioned above. The project was still fun but I enjoyed the experience of the Jack in the box more.
