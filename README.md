## Planning - detailed description with images
#### Purpose & Expectations
> To work diligently in order to create a product that improves and expands our overall knowledge of how basic engineering operates.  We are expected to work professionally, using our time and resources wisely.  We are expected to work with our partners efficiently to create an object that operates under the parameters provided. With this we will create a device that incorporates all of the aspects of engineering we have learned about to scare and startle those who arenâ€™t scared and startled enough in an effort to make the world a less scared-and-startle-free space.

#### Description (establishing the foundation)
#### Planning Document
[Here is the planning doc that was created pre-creation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ydlslu0jilWMhaa84WuWhr467ZRmgDgo2GTIVmntT8/edit#heading=h.ukbi0a75zb46)

## Materials Used

## CAD Model - Link and Images
#### Description
> In order to fit all of the necessary aspects incorporated with the Box such as the wires, battery mount (power supply), arduino and breadboard, and photoresistor, we needed an area to store all of this.  This is where the base came in, as we decided that with a base we would be able to fit all of the necessary components while still having a singular box, as the jack and the base would attach to each other.  We did this using a friction fit style, creating a 5 side box with an open top, using 3mm acrylic to reserve material and resources.  Next, in order to make the box stay on the box we had to make a shelf, aligned across the inside of each wall that the Jack in the Box could sit on.  Then, we extruded and cut as necessary in order to provide holes for screws, switches, ect.  Finally, we needed a top to this box that was removable for adjustments but sturdy to provide something for the springs to push against; we did this also using acrylic, and we provided open spaces for the photoresistor and breadboard as necessary, while designing it so that it would fit snug across to shelf designed on the walls of the base.

#### Reflection
> All in all the construction and printing itself was relatively easy despite a few hiccups, however after going through it, here are a few takeaways from my experience creating this...
>- When possible, always try to use acrylic and laser cut. We had originally planned to 3D print the entire thing, however that would have cost almost 10 times the amount of, which was especially helpful considering the fact that we had to reprint.
>- Friction fit is an extremely efficient and easy way to attach things such as a box together.
>- Always leave yourself more room than anticipated. This came up as we had originally not left ourselves enough space to make the actual Jack attach to the base, however we were able to fix this through extruding the walls 3mm's up and then reprinting.
>- Mentaly walk through the design and the CONSTRUCTION OF THE OTHER PIECES TO THE BOX! I say this because we had trouble attaching the different aspects because they seemed to fit on OnShape; however when doing it by hand it was much more difficult, so just double check.
>All in all it was a fun build and I am super happy with the way it came out.
